## üéôÔ∏è Why Dictator?

Dictator adds voice-powered control to your Cursor Chat workflow.  
Instead of typing every request, simply speak your prompt and let the AI transcribe it instantly.  

With Dictator, you can:
- üé§ Dictate ideas, code changes, or documentation without breaking your flow
- ‚ö° Speed up repetitive tasks by speaking instead of typing
- üåç Support multiple transcription models and languages
- üñ±Ô∏è Pair with one-click template injection for ultra-fast prompting

Because sometimes the fastest way to code‚Ä¶ is to just say it.

## ‚ö° Power Tools ‚Äì Design Your Own Prompts
Create, customize, and reuse powerful AI prompts tailored to your workflow.  
With Power Tools, you can:
- Save frequently used prompts for one-click access
- Organize them into categories for different tasks (e.g., bug fixing, code review, documentation)
- Inject prompts directly into Cursor Chat without retyping
- Share your prompt collections with your team to maintain consistency

Empower your AI-assisted development with templates that work exactly the way you do.
